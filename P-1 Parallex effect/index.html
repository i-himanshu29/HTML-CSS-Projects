            </div>
                <p class="text">
                    Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.
                    <br><br>
                    If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.
                    <br><br>

                    You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
                    <br>
                    If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking.
                     You can do it on trails and different types of rough terrain.

            </div>
                <p class="text">
                    Paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a 
                    wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Paragliders use lifting air (thermals) in exactly the same way as other gliding aircraft, although their low speed precludes their use in strong winds. Using thermal lift, soaring flights of 100 miles (160 km) are common. In competition pilots fly routes to distant goals, recording their progress by aerial photographs or GPS (Global Positioning System) traces. In favourable weather the routes may be 60 miles (100 km) or more and incorporate several turn points.
                     By the late 1990s the world record for straight distance was 208 miles (335 km). The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) World Paragliding Championships have been held every other year since the first championship at Kössen,
                      Austria, in 1989. England hosted the first World Paragliding Accuracy Landing Championship in 2000.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">
                    Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. 
                    Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch the ocean, river, or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break and lose their energy.
